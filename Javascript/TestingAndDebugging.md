<!-- Testing and Debugging -->

1. Using console.log() to debug:

--> console.log() prints variable values, function results, or messages to the browser console to help identify issues in code.


2. Unit test:

--> A unit test checks a small part of code, like a function, to ensure it works correctly. Unit testing helps catch bugs early and improve code quality.


3. Linters (e.g., ESLint):

--> A linter checks for coding errors and enforces style rules, helping keep code consistent and reducing potential bugs.


4. Breakpoints:

--> Breakpoints are set in the browserâ€™s developer tools to pause code at specific points, allowing you to inspect variable values and code flow step-by-step. This is helpful for tracking down bugs.
