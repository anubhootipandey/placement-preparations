<!-- Authentication and Security -->

1. How do you handle authentication in a Next.js application?

--> Authentication can be handled with libraries like NextAuth.js or Firebase, which manage user sessions and token-based authentication for Next.js apps.


2. Explain how you would set up authentication using NextAuth.js with Next.js.

--> Install NextAuth, configure it in the pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js file, and specify providers (like Google or GitHub) for login. NextAuth manages the session and user data, making setup easy.


3. How does Next.js manage session tokens securely?

--> Next.js stores session tokens securely, often in HTTP-only cookies, which prevent JavaScript access and reduce vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.


4. How can you protect certain pages or routes in Next.js?

--> You can protect routes by checking the user’s authentication status in getServerSideProps or using a wrapper component that restricts access and redirects users if they’re not logged in.


5. What security features does Next.js offer for production applications?

--> Next.js has built-in protections against XSS, secure cookies for session handling, and HTTP headers (like Content Security Policy) that help defend against common security threats.
