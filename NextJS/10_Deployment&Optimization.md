<!-- Deployment and Optimization -->

1. How can you deploy a Next.js application on Vercel?

--> You can deploy Next.js on Vercel by linking your GitHub repository to Vercel. Each push to the main branch will automatically deploy, making Vercel a simple solution for Next.js deployment.


2. What are the main optimizations Next.js offers for performance?

--> Next.js provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, image optimization, lazy loading, and incremental static regeneration, all of which enhance site speed and performance.


3. How does Next.js handle automatic code-splitting?

--> Next.js automatically splits code by only loading the JavaScript needed for the page that’s currently being viewed. This reduces load times since unused code isn’t loaded upfront.


4. What are some strategies for optimizing build performance in Next.js?

--> To optimize build times, you can split pages into smaller components, use caching, optimize images and static assets, and avoid unnecessary code in your getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions.


5. Can you deploy Next.js on platforms other than Vercel? If so, how?

--> Yes, you can deploy on other platforms like Netlify, AWS, or DigitalOcean. You’ll need to export the app as a static site or use custom server configurations depending on the platform’s setup.
