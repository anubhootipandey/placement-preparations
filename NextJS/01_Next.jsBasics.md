<!-- Next.js Basics -->

1. What is Next.js, and how does it differ from React?

--> Next.js is a framework built on top of React, which means it uses React’s components but adds extra tools and features to make building websites easier and faster. While React focuses on building user interfaces (UI), Next.js provides additional features like server-side rendering, file-based routing, and optimized performance, helping you build websites that are faster and better optimized.


2. Explain the advantages of using Next.js for web development.

--> Next.js makes websites faster and more efficient by supporting server-side rendering and static generation, both of which improve load times and SEO. It has built-in routing (like navigating between pages), image optimization, and good default settings for SEO, making it a great choice for building high-quality, production-ready websites quickly.


3. How does Next.js handle server-side rendering?

--> Server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js means generating the HTML of a page on the server when a user requests it. This process allows the content to be ready before it reaches the user’s browser, making the initial load much faster and improving SEO since search engines can see the full content immediately.


4. Describe the main features Next.js provides out of the box.

--> Next.js provides several important features that make it easier to build websites:
Routing: Automatic page navigation based on the folder structure.
Server-side and static generation: Lets you choose how and when pages are generated.
API routes: Enables you to create backend API endpoints within your app.
Optimized images and fonts: Reduces load time and improves visuals.
Built-in support for CSS and Sass: Makes styling easier.


5. What are the benefits of static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?

--> With SSG, Next.js generates the HTML for pages at build time, not when users visit. This makes pages load instantly because they’re pre-built and don’t require server processing each time. SSG is great for pages that don’t need frequent updates, and it improves performance and SEO since the content is ready for search engines to crawl.
