If you are looking to make your first open source contribution, follow the steps below.

1.Go to the repository in which you want to contribute.
2.Fork the repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of github repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your account.
3.Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
4.Open a terminal and run the following git command:
  -->git clone "url you just copied" (where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of the project)).

/***********For example:
        git clone git@github.com:(yourgithubusername)/(the forked repository name).git
        where yourgithubusername is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the forked repository on GitHub to your computer.
***********/

  -->Create a branch
        Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
  -->cd (forked repository name)
        Now create a branch using the git switch command:
            -->>git switch -c your-new-branch-name
  -->Make necessary changes and commit those changes
  -->git status
        If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.
  -->Now commit those changes using the git commit command:
        git commit -m "your comment"
  -->Push your changes using the command git push:
        git push -u origin your-branch-name
        replacing your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.
  -->If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.
        create a pull request
        Now submit the pull request.

Congrats! We've just completed the standard fork -> clone -> changes -> pull request workflow that you'll often encounter as an open source contributor!
